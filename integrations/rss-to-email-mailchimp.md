# How can I send an email to users when a new blog post is published?

## Sometimes you might want to allow visitors to sign up to a list and get an email when a new post is made on the blog. A simple way to do this is to combine Perch with MailChimp.

You can create an RSS feed for your blog using the included example feed. Our [video](http://docs.grabaperch.com/video/tutorials/swift/blog-rss-feed/) shows you how to customize this for your blog.

Once your feed is working and your site is available on the live server you can then follow the instructions on MailChimp to create an [RSS to Email Campaign](http://mailchimp.com/features/rss-to-email/).

To make it easy for visitors to sign up on your site, and in order that you can see how many signups you have had without leaving the Perch admin you can use our [MailChimp Add-on](https://grabaperch.com/add-ons/apps/mailchimp).
